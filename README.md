# Energy Efficiency ML

This project demonstrates a simple machine-learning pipeline for predicting building energy efficiency using synthetic data. The model uses building features such as wall area, roof area, overall height, and glazing area to predict energy efficiency ratings.

## ğŸ”§ Features

- ğŸ“Š Synthetic dataset generation
- ğŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn
- ğŸ¤– Machine Learning using Random Forest Regressor
- ğŸ“‰ Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error
- ğŸ“· Visualization of true vs predicted values



````

## ğŸš€ How It Works

1. Generate synthetic data for building features
2. Visualize feature relationships
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Random Forest regression model
5. Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error
6. Plot predicted vs actual energy efficiency values


## ğŸ“¦ Dependencies

Install with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib
````

## ğŸ“Œ Model Used

* `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble`

## ğŸ§  Insights

This synthetic model is a starting point for exploring energy efficiency prediction.
